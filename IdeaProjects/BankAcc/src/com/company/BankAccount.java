    //Question 1: when can you access private instance variables?
    //when you are writing code in the same class that the variable is in.

    //Part 2: getters and setters
    //getters and setters are non-static, they have access to the instance variables of an object.
    // Return a double because getBalance() should return the balance, which is a double.
    //we don't need an argument because we're asking what the value is, no extra info necessary.
    //Getters

        return balance;

    public String getName(){
        return name;
    }
    //Setters: return type is void because we are not returning anything.
    //setBalance() is just changing a value, not asking what the value is.
    //Because we're changing the value of balance, we need to know what the value will be, so we need an argument.
    //Setters:
    public void setBalance(double newBalance){
        balance = newBalance;
    }
    public void setName(String newName){
        name = newName;
    }

    //Question 2: A programmer decides that the accountâ€™s name should not be changeable. How would you accomplish this?
    //you can accomplish it by removing the setter. OR
    //you can make it private (the setter function)
